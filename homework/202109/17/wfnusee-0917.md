# Chapter 1 - Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

## 两种应用模式
- data intensive
- compute intensive

## data intensive system

typical data intensive system are:
- databases
- caches
- search indexes
- stream processing
- batch processing

the fundamentals of these systems are: realiable scalable and maintainable

- reliable: always work correctly
- scalability: easy to scale the system up to handle the growing requests
- maintainability: easy for many people work on the system together

## Why there are so many different systems?
Different application scenarios have different demand of the data accessing pattern or performance characteristics. 

But you can always build up a special-purpose and complicate systems from simple components.
