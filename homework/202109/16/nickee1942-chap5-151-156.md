# Leaders and followers
A follower is a replica of a leader. Client writes only happen on leaders. 
# Sync vs Async
## Sync pros and cons
### Pros	
Data could save in replica so it is consistent with the leader and would not lose if the leader is down
### Cons
Take times. Even time is short (usually in one second), the client needs to wait until data is saved in a replica

Usually, take one follower as sync. Other followers as async. Sync happened only on one follower. Other followers copy data behind the scenes
# Add followers
### Take a snapshot of the leader
### copy it to the new follower
### Record all the requests that happened after the snapshot and copy them to the follower
